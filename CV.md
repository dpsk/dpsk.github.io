I am a passionate and self-motivated web developer with a strong background in computer science and an aptitude for delivering high-quality, maintainable software. I have extensive knowledge of the Ruby programming language and a lot of experience working on bespoke Rails applications and their respective ecosystems.

I have led teams and projects to tackle technical debt and have completed large architectural refactors, whilst delivering business value. I have made decisions on mission critical code and successfully developed tools and methodologies to deal with high levels of risk.

I am actively involved in a number of development communities and regularly attend conferences and meet-ups. I am a strong advocate for open-source software, encouraging colleagues to work on projects that they find captivating and inspiring.

In my spare time, I enjoy running and playing football.
